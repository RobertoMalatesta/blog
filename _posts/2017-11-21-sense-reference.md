- Problem: what are the different kinds of statements about identity? 

- e.g. "the sun is the same every day", "the morning star is the evening star"

- [a continuum: "27 = 27", "27 = 26 + 1", "27 = 25 + 2", "$$\sum 1/x^2 = \pi / 6$$"]

- Is the interpretation of "a=b" that "'a' and 'b' designate the same thing"?

- No: then can only generate meta-statements about language and say nothing
  about the world. "A difference can arise only if the difference between the
  signs corresponds to the mode of presentation of that which is designated"

- [Compare: "the morning star is [called] Venus"]

- In addition to a referent, ever word has a _sense_ ("mode of presentation").

- [Is this just _sense_ = intension, _reference_ = extension?]

- "Comprehensive knowledge of the referent would require us to be able to say
  immediately whether every given sense belongs to it" (27) [i.e. what
  sense=computation is needed to pick this out?]

- Meta-discussion: how do we then refer to the sense of a word? Quotation marks
  will do.

- Third piece: _conception_---internal image, "saturated with feeling". [q.v.
  Wittgenstein, "what I experience in a stroke"]

- _Sense_ is speaker-independent, _conception_ is speaker-dependent. [So sense
  cannot be quite "what computation picks this out"---varies depending on state
  of speaker knowledge. But OK in the usual model-theoretic sense.]

- ["How do I identify Venus" as part of the _definition_ of Venus, consequently
  its sense.]

- Vocab: a name _expresses_ its sense and _designates_ its referent.

- What does a sentence refer to? A truth value.

- Replacing an entity sentence with a different part having the same
  referent is truth-value preserving. But what about replacing subordinate
  clauses?

- "I concluded that {Pat loves Lou}"

- In this case, the reference of the sentence is preserved when the _sense_ of
  the clause is preserved.

- What about "He {who discovered the elliptic form of the planetary orbits} died
  in misery"?

- [There's no embedded sentence here at all!]

- Bigger worry---what if "He who discovered..." doesn't refer to anything at
  all? Top-level sentence doesn't even have a truth value, b/c it doesn't
  compile.

- Frege: indeed, and people should speak in such a way that they avoid
  presupposition failures.

- [Discussions of various other grammatical phenomena.]

Obviously most of the ideas here are familiar given modern model-theoretic
accounts semantics and a better understanding of syntax. At the same time, it's
interesting historically. The version of this paper I have in my head has always
just been "nouns denote entities, sentences denote truth values, sense is
something else"; it's impressive to see how omany of the issues with modality,
presupposition failure & meta-linguistic discussion already come up here.
