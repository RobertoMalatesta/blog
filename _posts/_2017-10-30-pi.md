- Augustine's language: reference comes first. Language understanding is
  $p(x|w)$.

- Shopkeeper/builder's language: behavior comes first. Language understanding is
  $p(a|w,x)$.

- Latter subsumes former. To behave correctly, must be able to pay
  attention to the right things in response to given words; this is reference.
  [But is compositionality this easy?]

- "If we say, 'Every word in the language signifies something', we have so far
  said nothing _whatever_; unless we explain exactly _what_ distinction we want
  to make"
